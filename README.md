I am desireable software developer living in Tacoma, Wa. I was born in Costa Rica and raised in Alabama.

I chose to become a Software Developer to gain more knowledge on how tech can be utilized to beneifit us daily and give us more time to enjoy what we value in life. During the pandemic, I became a manager at an indoor garden. It was there that I became even more fascinated at how tech is intergrating into every sector and wanted to dig deeper to expand my understanding and contribute to the fast paced and ever evolving tech feild. My previous positions as a barista, housekeeper, wilderness conservationalist, painter, gardener, and licensed massage therapist have given me the oppurtunity to excel in connecting with people, communicating clear expectations, and crate plans that address the concerns and goals in each enviroment. Iam focused and determined to start as an entry-level software developer and gain the skills to work in machine automation and electric vehicles.
